# Mid-Latitude Forests: Fire Disturbances, Vertical Forest Structure, and Herbaceous Plant Communities

## Project Description
This study aims to examine the impact of fire disturbance regimes on forest structure (Approach 1) with a particular focus on the herbaceous layer in mid-latitude forests (Approach 2). To do this, I will identify differences in herbaceous communities and vertical forest structures in regions that experience both extremes of fire disturbance (fire suppression and severe wildfire) and areas with prescribed burning management plans (Approach 3).
By reintroducing low-intensity fires, I predict that we can promote overall resilience and biodiversity, manage invasive species, and better understand the role of the herbaceous layer in maintaining healthy ecosystems. We are responsible for investing in research, education, and sustainable management practices to ensure these critical ecosystems' long-term health and vitality.

**We aim to examine:**
1. the changes impacting this regionâ€™s herbaceous vegetation and fire regimes,
2. how human-led fire suppression has altered these systems,
3. the changes to vegetation, forest structure, and wildfire risk that higher latitudes may soon experience with climate change, and
4. how we can better manage these regimes to reduce risk to a region with a significant wildland-urban interface.
